            <h2>How to Build a Skincare Routine</h2>
        
            <p><em>*Disclaimer: This information is for entertainment purposes only. I am not an expert. If you have any skin concerns, please consult a doctor, and always follow the manufacturer’s guide on how to use a product.*</em></p>
                <hr>
        
            <p>Today, I would like to move away from my more serious discussions of media, and rather focus on another passion of mine: skincare. Like most of us, I have had a fairly complicated relationship with my skin that made me spend a lot of time (and money) researching and trying skincare products and ingredients until I understood what was causing and how to treat the concerns I had with my skin (in my case breakouts, hyperpigmentation, dry patches and now also fine lines). To me, skincare has become a hobby I genuinely enjoy, but I know to many of us skincare is a chore, simply a sign of vanity, or even an unnecessary expense.</p>
        
            <p>Similar to the fashion, makeup and diet industry, skincare is part of a system that is largely designed to make us (mainly women, but men are definitely not excluded from this) believe we need to invest a lot of time and money into fixing an arbitrary problem. This problem will also change every couple of years so that we have to buy yet another fix. It is important to understand that there is a reason why we feel a certain way about our bodies and why we perceive certain aspects as a problem – because someone has told us what is deemed desirable in our society. </p>
        
            <p>Nonetheless, your skin is your biggest organ, and skincare is about maintaining the health of that organ. Looking past extensive marketing, what the industry likes to call a ‘problem’ tends to be a sign that your skin is unhappy or that there is an imbalance in your health. The right skincare routine will keep your skin healthy and make you feel comfortable – no one enjoys itchy or dry skin. There is also nothing wrong with wanting to look nice as long as <em>you</em> decide what ‘nice’ means to you. You should be able to feel comfortable in your own skin, whether that means you embrace your acne or that you want to avoid wrinkles – it is your choice. Skincare does not have to be expensive or time-consuming, but it is a form of health- and self-care which – to a certain extend – we should all practice.</p>
        
            <p>Here are my 10 tips and tricks to a healthy skincare routine:</p>
        
            <div>
                <h3>1. Know Your Skin Type</h3>
                <p>I cannot emphasise this enough as I have created so much damage to my skin by ignoring my skin type. In my case, I used acne products on my combination skin, which then stripped my skin of all its natural oils, therefore causing it to overcompensate and <em>overproduce</em> oils, leading to acne-like breakouts that I had to battle with for years.</p>
        
                <p>I think a lot of us have certain ideas about our skin – it’s dry, it’s oily, it’s sensitive – without actually paying attention to it in the first place. Try and focus on your skin: where is it dry, where is it oily? How does it react to certain ingredients? Understand what your skin type is, then use products that are specifically tailored to you and your skin. Sometimes, you will have to use different products on different areas on your skin, but in the long run, your skin should become happy and healthy if you pay attention to it.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>2. Start with Small Steps</h3>
                <p>Skincare can be incredibly intimidating, but no matter what marketing, influencers and trends want to tell you, you do not need a 20-, 10-, 7- or even 5-step skincare routine. Especially if you are only just starting, a basic routine made out of 2 steps can be very effective: cleansing and moisturising.</p>
        
                <p>Wash your face every morning and evening. Ideally, you should use a gentle cleanser, especially in the evenings because dirt and oils can build up during the day, but just water can be fine as well. Follow by a moisturiser that leaves your skin feeling hydrated and healthy. There you go, you have a skincare routine.</p>
        
                <p>If there is nothing specific that you want to target or accomplish with your routine, these 2 steps are absolutely enough and only take an extra minute each time. Otherwise, for targeting breakouts, anti-ageing, dryness, etc., you might want to eventually add a third treatment step. Try to only do this when you feel ready for it – small steps help your skin adjust to the new products and help you adjust to the extra time you are spending each day. Only add extra steps, if they are not going to overwhelm you and if they are sustainable for you – whether that means adding a third or even a 10th step. Skincare should not be rushed, and adding products and steps slowly to your routine makes it more likely that you are going to stick with it.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>3. Exfoliation: Physical vs. Chemical</h3>
                <p>Gentle exfoliation can help getting rid of dead skin cells which would usually end up clogging your pores and causing breakouts, or leave your skin looking dry and flaky. Exfoliation can also uncover young skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and making your skin look fresh, healthy and glowing.</p>
        
                <p>There are 2 types of exfoliation: physical and chemical. Physical exfoliation has been more common, especially in the form of facial scrubs with exfoliating beads. Unfortunately, many of these scrubs are either bad for you or the environment. Many beads are made of microplastics which has been incredibly damaging to the environment. Other natural beads are made from fruit pits (i.e. apricot) or coffee grounds, which tend to have tiny sharp edges that can lead to microtears in your skin, damaging it in the long run. We also tend to be way too harsh on our skin even when using scrubs with sugar or salt beads which dissolve in water and should be gentler. I know there is nothing more satisfying than aggressively scrubbing your face on what you perceive as a problem area but being harsh on your skin again could cause microtears, irritation or sensitivity If you are a big fan of physical exfoliants, make sure to use beads that can dissolve in water and be as gentle with your skin as you can be.</p>
        
                <p>Despite dissolving dead skin cells with acid, chemical exfoliation tends to be a lot gentler than scrubs. There are so many different formulas out there, and if you find the right acid in the right percentage for your skin, chemical exfoliation can do wonders for your overall complexion. Visible results, unfortunately, take a lot longer than with scrubs, and your skin first needs to build a tolerance to the acid. Slowly introduce acids to your routine by using them only once or twice per week until it feels like your skin can handle more. When using acids, there can be a slight tingle on your skin, but if it is painful, wash the product off and start with a lower percentage. </p>
        
                <p>Whichever type of exfoliation you decide on, make sure to use sunscreen for at least 7 days afterwards as the newly revealed skin is more sensitive to sun exposure.</p>

                <h3>4. Know Your Actives</h3>
                <p>Many products will promise you the world: get rid of your acne, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation while simultaneously treating dryness, getting you that pay-rise you wanted, and win the lottery. Yet, when you actually check their ingredients list, often there will be no ingredient that supports that claim. Be aware that the front of a product is mainly marketing, but it is the ingredients list that counts. I am not particularly great at understanding ingredients (yet) because there are so many and it is difficult to know what each and every one does. However, here is a list of my favourite active ingredients that you might want to look out for:</p>
        
                <h4>AHA's:</h4>
                <p>A form of chemical exfoliation. Typically, ingredients tend to be glycolic acid or lactic acids but there are many more. In low dosage, AHA’s can be a very gentle form of exfoliation that reveals beautiful skin underneath. Helps even out skin tone and reduces fine lines. Also available in very high dosages (up to 30%) for a powerful exfoliating effect.</p>
        
                <h4>BHA's:</h4>
                <p>Also known as salicylic acid, another form of a chemical exfoliant. If you struggle with breakouts, oily skin, blackheads and enlarged pores, you definitely want to include salicylic acid in your routine. In comparison to AHA’s, BHA’s are oil-soluble so they can go even deeper into your pores for a cleansing effect. The highest over the counter dosage of salicylic acid is 2%.</p>
        
                <h4>Hyaluronic Acid:</h4>
                <p>This is probably one of the most common ingredients at the moment, especially in products for dry skin. Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, meaning it attracts and retains water. One of the most talked-about facts concerning hyaluronic acid is that it can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, so it can be an incredible ingredient for dry skin. It is also a fairly cheap ingredient, so watch out for overpriced miracle serums in the skincare industry. Be aware that if you use a hyaluronic acid serum, you always (and as soon as possible) need to follow it up with a preferably heavy moisturiser. As mentioned, it attracts water, and you do not want it to pull the water out of your own skin but rather out of another product.</p>
        
                <h4>Retinol:</h4>
                <p>A derivative of Vitamin A. I haven’t actually used retinol or retinoids yet, so you might wonder, why it is on my list of favourites. Retinol is the only anti-ageing ingredient that is actually proven to work. It helps the skin build collagen and therefore remain its elasticity and prevent wrinkles. It also has an exfoliating effect, helps with acne, evens out skin tones and helps against sun damage. Retinol is another product you want to introduce slowly to your skin and only in a low dosage. Highest over the counter dosage is 1% but a dermatologist can prescribe you stronger retinols if you have specific skin concerns. </p>
        
                <h4>Vitamin C:</h4>
                <p>Probably my favourite ingredient. It is an antioxidant that protects the skin from radicals, and it can actually boost your sunscreen if you apply Vitamin C in the morning. Due to its acidity, Vitamin C is also a slight exfoliant and one of the best ingredients to brighten skin and hyperpigmentation, and to help with scar healing. Vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) comes in many dosages so you should be able to find one that suits your skin best. Be aware that it should be stored in dark packaging as it is highly unstable and very sensitive to light. Vitamin C is also a more expensive ingredient, so you might have to spend a bit more.</p>

                <h3>5. How to Layer</h3>
                <p>Once you have found the active ingredients that work for you, you need to figure out when to use them in your routine. You should make sure that your products can penetrate your skin and fulfil their potential. While there are many rules and tips when it comes to layering products, I have found this guideline to be the easiest: go by the product’s consistency.</p>
        
                <p>For products staying on your face (i.e. toner, serum, essence, mask, moisturiser) you want to layer it thinnest to thickest. Start with products that have a light, watery consistency, and end with seclusive products that have a heavier if even oily consistency. That way, no product has to fight through an extra layer of oil and your products should work most effectively.</p> 
            </div>
        
            <div>
                <h3>6. Sunscreen</h3>
                <p>Sunscreen is a non-negotiable skincare product. Even if you do not have a skincare routine, even if you do not wash your face at all, even if it is winter, you have to apply sunscreen every morning. It is not really a skincare product; it is a healthcare product.</p>
        
                <p>Wearing sunscreen is one of the only ways we can protect our skin from melanomas or skin cancer. The sun, even when it is not visible, can do loads of damage to our skin, and any damage or sunburn is dangerous in the long run. Especially the face is exposed to UVA and UVB rays every day, so you have to protect it. Sun damage can also lead to premature wrinkles and (hyper)pigmentation, so wearing sunscreen has an added benefit of working as an anti-ageing product. Some products (like exfoliants or retinols) will leave your face even more sensitive to sun damage, making it extra important to wear an SPF of at least 30 (but preferably higher) during those times.</p>
        
                <p>If sunscreens tend to leave a white cast on your face, avoid physical sunscreens (ingredients to look out for: zinc oxide or titanium oxide), and rather use chemical sunscreens (ingredients to look out for: oxybenzone, avobenzone, octinoxate or octisalat). Sunscreens specifically formulated for the face tend to be non-comedogenic, meaning they should not clog your pores or leave your face sticky. You can also choose a moisturiser with integrated SPF, just beware how much moisturiser you need to use to get its full benefit. Reapply multiple times during the day. (There are sunscreen powders that can be very helpful to reapply SPF during the day if you are wearing makeup or become very shiny.) </p>

            <div>
                <h3>7. Less Can Be More</h3>
                <p>Over the past years, using more and more products has turned into a huge trend, if not an obsession. Having a 10-step skincare routine might be fun every once in a while, but as part of a daily routine it just isn’t sustainable (at least not for me): it wastes time, product and money. Furthermore, the more products you have on your face, the more likely it is that you won’t get the full benefit of each product, either because you wrongly layered them, or because the products are reacting to each other. Some ingredients – for example, retinol and Vitamin C – can cancel each other out so using them at the same time does nothing.</p>
        
                <p>For me, I have found shorter skincare routines to be the most effective. Not only does it save me so much time and money, but I get the most benefit from my products. Active ingredients do not have to penetrate through layers upon layers in order to get to my skin, and my skin does not overreact or show sensitivity because it can still breathe. Despite what marketing would like you to believe, sometimes it is the smarter choice to scale down. Less can indeed be more when it comes to your skin. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div>
                <h3>8. Be Gentle</h3>
                <p>You only get one skin so you should treat it mindfully. Harshness – whether it is a harsh product or harsh application – can increase or even cause skin damage. Use lukewarm water while washing the face as hot water tends to dry you out. When using a cleanser, gently massage your face and pad-dry afterwards with a fresh towel – no rubbing. You also want to gently pad products into the skin so that they absorb better. Use very little force, especially around the delicate eye area. Tugging on your skin can cause microtears, sensitivity or wrinkles, and at the end of your routine, your skin should feel well-cared for. It should not sting or burn, it should not feel tight – if it does, some of your products could be too harsh for your skin type. Also, try and remember that skincare can be self-care. Being gentle to your skin means being gentle and kind to yourself. Remind yourself that you deserve to take a few minutes of the day to just care for yourself. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div>
                <h3>9. Be Patient</h3>
                <p>There is no such thing as a miracle or an overnight product. It will take time to see results, so be patient and do not throw a product away if it did not fulfil its promise after only a few applications. Results are in direct correlation with the turnover rate of your skin, which – depending on your age – can vary between 21 to 60 days (if not even more). There are also many other factors when it comes to your skin. Stress, hormones, sleep and nutrition may have a huge effect. So, allow your skin to go through its natural cycle and keep an eye on external factors while deciding whether a product is working for you. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div>
                <h3>10. Know <em>your</em> Skin</h3>
                <p>It is important to know that every skin is different. What works for a friend or an influencer might not work at all for you. There is not this one product that will work for every person and simultaneously treat any skin concern. I think we tend to get so distracted by shiny looks, good reviews, our favourite celebrity telling us <i>this product has changed their skin</i>, that we forget how we already know this specific active ingredient does not work for us. If it works for them, it must work for me. Try not to waste your time and money like that. Listen to your skin – it will tell you when it likes a product and when it does not. Understand which actives work for you, how many steps <em>you</em> need, if certain ingredients make your skin sensitive. The more attention you pay to your skin, the better you will understand its needs and eventually skincare will become easy. Do not let anyone else tell you what you need based on their experience, rather be confident that you made the right decision for <em>your</em> skin. If you found any of my tips helpful, that’s great! But if you disagree with me, that’s even better. No one can tell you what will work for you unless your own skin. Take from my tips what you want and ignore the rest. After all, it is your skin.</p>
