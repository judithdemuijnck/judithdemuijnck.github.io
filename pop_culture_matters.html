            <h2>Why Pop Culture Matters: An Introduction</h2>
            <p>There seems to be a basic catalogue of assumptions that comes with the term ‘literary studies:’ that you are well-read, that you are an expert of literary classics, that poetry is your bedtime reading, and that you can finish any given Shakespeare quote. My experience at university, however, was different from that. While I have had my fair share reading and analysing past and current classics, I also never had to read a single line of Shakespeare. My studies were fairly open; we could choose our classes freely as long as they fit within certain modules, and early on we were encouraged to focus on our interests and skills. For me, I quickly realized that I had a fascination with the more modern aspects of literature: pop culture.</p>
        
            <p>There are many people out there who do not see importance in pop culture. Not necessarily because they do not consume it – most of us consume pop culture in one way or the other – but because it was created for mass consumption and profit rather than for art. Only very rarely is there a secret meaning behind a current blockbuster, so why should it deserve the attention of literary and cultural scientists?</p>
        
            <p>Of course, no piece of media ever stands on its own. It is always influenced by history and culture. Not only does culture influence media, but media influences culture as well. This applies to artfully-crafted literature and movies, as well as any mainstream TV-series and pulp fiction. Furthermore, pop culture will always have a bigger influence on society as it is easily approachable. It is incredibly important not to overlook how our society is portrayed through media, as it is where many of us gain an understanding of our own existence. This is why the representation of diversity and minorities is so important. Not only will it help us to understand how diverse our lives as humans actually are, but I also believe each and every individual should be able to see themselves represented in order to understand that their identity is valid and that their experience is not isolated.</p>
        
            <p>Media has become a massive part of our culture and our life, yet we are only now starting to realize its influence. Whether it is yet another all-white cast of an Oscar-nominated movie, another death of a homosexual character, or even just a Kardashian trying to sell us the newest variation of a laxative presented as a detox-tea: media changes the way we look at our bodies, at our achievements, at our own worth and existence. It makes us believe that the world is supposed to only look a very certain way and if we do not fit that mould, then something has to be wrong with us. How could our existence be valid if it is not part of how our world is presented to us? What we see in the media is what we perceive as normal – which is why we need to do so much better when it comes to the writing and representation of queer characters, of women, of POC, of disabled characters, or any other character that is currently mis- or underrepresented.</p>
        
            <p>We have given media the power that it currently holds, so it is important to understand that representation matters and that we need to do better and hold it to higher standards. Pop culture is not only a reflection of how we see our world at a certain point of time – it <em>influences</em> how we see our world at a certain time. It seems that we are finally at a turning point where we are beginning to realize how we have to change. Diversity is more talked about than ever and new media is coming out every day that confronts topics that only a couple of years ago were taboo. Personally, I am excited to see how pop culture will evolve. In the meantime, we can use this blog to talk about what it is currently doing right – and what it is currently doing wrong.</p>
