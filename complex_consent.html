        <h2>Outside: One Day at a Time and the Complexity of Consent</h2>
        <p>Ever since its release in 2017, the Netflix show <i>One Day at a Time</i> has not shied away from addressing complicated and current topics such as racism and sexism, as well as giving a platform to Latinx and the LGBTQ+ community. The season 3 episode "Outside" is a direct answer to the #MeToo movement that has seen an abundance of women (and men!) finally come forward about sexual harassment. As always, <i>One Day at a Time</i> manages to tackle a heavy topic both with humour and sincerity, aiming not just to comment on a current situation but also to spark a discussion.</p>
        
        <p>"Outside" deals with mother Penelope finding photos of her teenage son Alex groping his girlfriend. When she confronts him about his behaviour, a conversation about consent starts between three generations. The three women – grandmother Lydia, mother Penelope, and daughter Elena – all share similar experiences, yet have very different views about them. While Lydia enjoys getting attention from men and misses the old days, both Penelope and Elena had negative experiences with sexual harassment; Penelope’s army tutor moved her hand to his crotch, and Elena and her non-binary partner Syd were harassed by boys on the bus who wanted them to kiss for their visual pleasure.</p>
        
        <p>"Outside" hits close to home for many women. Most of us have experienced the anxiety of being followed by men, the fear of speaking up, the disappointment of men not having to face consequences, and the anger of feeling like not having done enough. Yet "Outside" also includes men in the conversation: not only does the teenage boy eventually learn from the trauma of the women in his family, but his mother Penelope also acknowledges that men are lacking explicit guidelines and role models and therefore no longer know how to behave. “I hate to admit it, but I feel sorry for men,” she says. “This consent thing is tricky” (15:58). Rather than just blaming men, she wants to open a conversation.</p>
        
        <p>Penelope is correct: consent is complex. No matter how much we would like it to be a black or white situation, it is never as easy as a “yes” or “no” question. While we have finally moved away from the understanding that only saying “no” means not giving consent – which in itself implies that consent is something that has to be taken away rather than given – simply saying “yes” does not equal giving consent either. There are many situations in which it is not safe to say “no,” and sometimes it is physically impossible (i.e. being asleep, drunk, or in a frozen state). A “yes” therefore does not automatically equal consent. Elena describes consent as the following: “It can’t just be a ‘yes,’ it has to be an <em>enthusiastic</em> ‘yes’” (14:12). However, while definitely a good guideline, even this does not entirely grasp the concept of consent.</p>
        
        <p>Consent is an enthusiastic “yes” that can be given both verbally <em>and</em> non-verbally – and non-verbal communication is prone to miscommunication. Chances are, if you are in a relationship, you will not ask for consent every single time you touch your partner. Even Elena – who has been preaching about her understanding of consent – did not ask Syd before their first kiss. In certain situations, consent seems to be implied. Furthermore, each individual might have their own understanding of what consent means to them. So how the hell can we make sure that consent is given?</p>
        
        <p>The easiest answer seems to be: ask and tell. Ask before your actions, check-up regularly if your actions are still wanted, and if you still feel unsure, ask again. In the same scenario, you also have to say what it is you want, whether actions towards you are wanted, and if you are feeling violated at any point, then speak up. However, even though this seems to be a relatively simple approach, it is not foolproof. As previously mentioned, a “yes” does not always actually mean “yes.” How the hell do we know whether the person next to us is truly consenting? Even when we check in regularly, they might still not feel comfortable to say “no,” and enthusiasm can be faked as well. On the other end, not giving consent can also be faked during role-play. In fact, I’ve recently read an article (linked below) that ever since <i>50 Shades of Gray</i>, not only rape but also murder has been justified as consented-rough-sex-gone-wrong.</p>
        
        <p>So, are we doomed then? Is there no way of truly finding out whether we have been given consent? There is no simple solution to this. To me, it seems that consent is so much more than just asking for it, and it is even so much more than just reading and understanding a situation correctly. It is about creating a safe space where everyone involved feels comfortable to express what they are feeling: to give consent, to withdraw it, to say what they want and like. Only then can consent truly be given.</p>
        
        <p>When it comes to complex concepts like consent, it is incredibly important to understand that mistakes will happen and that does not necessarily turn anyone involved into a bad person. You and your (sexual or romantic) partner can have different arrangements when it comes to consent: you might have discussed that consent is implied, or that you want to be asked every single time, or even that you want to try out a kink that plays with the idea of denying consent. Whatever your arrangement is, communication is key to create that aforementioned safe space. Make sure to always communicate what it is you want and expect. Ask questions if you are unsure, and openly voice concerns as well. Most importantly, if someone points out your mistakes, do not get defensive. Accept that you have been wrong, apologise, and then move on.</p>
        
        <p>In the end, let’s try not to overcomplicate it: as long as you and everyone involved is happy with the arrangement that you have, everything is fine.</p>
