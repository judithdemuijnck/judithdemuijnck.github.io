        <h2 class="headline">Lolita &amp; the Unreliable Narrator</h2>
        
        <p>When I was reading Vladimir Nabokov’s 1955 novel <i>Lolita</i> this summer, I couldn’t quite figure out what it was that felt disturbing to me during the experience. It was not the depiction of a sexual relationship between a grown man and a teenage girl – I was aware of the contents of the book before I started reading it, so their relationship was neither necessarily surprising nor disturbing. In fact, their relationship was not portrayed creepy at all; rather it seemed consensual and exciting, almost like the flirty beginning of any blossoming relationship. Eventually, it took me almost half of the book to finally put my figure on what exactly was disturbing me in <i>Lolita</i>: Humbert Humbert is one of the best examples of an unreliable narrator that I have ever come across.</p>
        
        <p>The unreliable narrator is one of my favourite stylistic devices because it challenges what we perceive as the norm of our reading experience. The narrator is the voice of the story and usually, we will take it for gospel since it is the only voice we get to hear. We depend on the narrator telling us the truth, as it is our only entry to the plot. Our instinct is not to challenge what we are being told. So, when the narrator becomes unreliable – when he is lying or bending the truth, omitting facts, or simply is not capable of telling the (full) story – our reading experience can become both exciting and frustrating. Exciting because we suddenly become detectives: we get to question the plot, draw the truths from what we have read and make our own story out of it. Frustrating because not always will we find out whether our understanding has been right and what actually happened.</p>
        
        <p>In general, if you find homodiegetic (first-person) narration, you should be doubting the truth of their accounts. Any first-person narrator is unreliable in some capacity: it is only human to tell our own truth which is very often subjective and also not entirely correct. We are the unreliable narrators of our own stories – which underlines that unreliability does not always mean malicious intent or intentional misinformation. Hazel Grace from <i>The Fault in Our Stars</i> (John Green) is an unreliable narrator because she is a teenager who does not fully grasp mathematical concepts that she preaches as the truth. <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> (Mark Haddon) and <i>When Mr Dog Bites</i> (Brian Conaghan) are both examples of an unreliable narrator with a mental disability which again challenges our usual reading experience. One of my favourite examples of an unreliable narrator, however, comes from malicious intent: Agatha Christie’s masterpiece <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> is narrated by the murderer who simply omits information and therefore is only outed at the end by detective Poirot without any previous hints at this outcoming.</p>
        
        <p>While an unreliable narrator offers a lot to the reading experience, it also means the reader has to be switched on. If they are not, the best-case scenario leads to confusion and disturbance (as it did with me and <i>Lolita</i>), whereas the worst-case scenario leads to a serious misunderstanding that might not always be harmless. I do not know exactly how I missed that Humbert was unreliable: he writes his accounts in prison as a defense and therefore will clearly alter facts to put himself into a better light. Nothing that happens between him and Lolita seems to be Humbert’s fault, rather, she seems to be the one who is initiating it and wanting it. Lolita is presented as promiscuous, experienced and sexually exploring. She hops from one sexual relationship to the other, often with men who are much older than her. She has been teasing Humbert for a while and is clearly responsible when they finally sleep together – except she is not. This is simply how Humbert is framing her and we have no proof except for the words of an imprisoned man who has a sexual obsession with nymphs. Humbert is defending his actions and giving responsibility to a young teenager. Humbert’s accounts of the story are very likely untrue. In other words: when he describes how Lolita wants to show him this game that she has learned at summer camp and seduces him, it is a description of Humbert raping her.</p>
        
        <p>What is even more disturbing is that Humbert’s narrative has framed how we understand <i>Lolita</i> today. Few people will have read <i>Lolita</i>, yet the word ‘Lolita’ has entered our vocabulary as the title of a promiscuous girl – not as the title of a girl who is raped by her stepfather. Even the title of the novel is framed through his perspective: Lolita is only a nickname given to her by Humbert, yet barely anyone knows that her name is actually Dolores. Maybe that is why Nabokov named her Dolores (Latin for pain): because <i>Lolita</i> hauntingly shows the pain of a young woman’s narrative being framed through the words of an obsessive man – a metaphor that is still very topical today. </p>
