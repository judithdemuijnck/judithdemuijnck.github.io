            <h2>Book Review: Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows</h2>
        
            <p><i>Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows</i> by Balli Kaur Jaswal immediately intrigued me because of its expressive title. I imagined a plot similar to the movie <i>Book Club</i>, directed by Bill Holderman, in which a group of four older women (re-)discover their sexuality by reading <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> in their book club. I was convinced this novel would be very similar: older women, this time from a different cultural background, (re-)discovering their sexuality through a creative writing club. To be honest, I am still not entirely sure if <i>Erotic Stories by Punjabi Widows</i> fulfilled my expectations, and what to make of this book.</p>
        
            <p>I guess it shows my own cultural naivety that I believed the plot for this novel could be so simple: of course it cannot just be about Punjabi widows writing erotic stories. Rather it is about these women finding their own voices and in some cases empowerment in a culture that seemingly silences them.</p>
        
            <p>Set in Southall, London, <i>Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows</i> shows the struggles of both first- and second-generation immigrants finding a balance between their (parents’) culture and a promising Western lifestyle. Main character Nikki cannot fulfil her Sikh parents’ expectations: she does not want an arranged marriage, and she dropped out of law school and is now working in a pub while trying to figure out what she wants from her future. In her local Sikh Community Centre, Nikki signs up to teach what she thinks will be a creative writing class, only to figure out that her students are mainly illiterate Punjabi widows who want to learn how to write. Not too soon after, however, their focus shifts to telling and writing down erotic stories, showing they have desires as well. This newfound empowerment inspires all of the characters – young and old, traditional and modern – to make changes to their lives to improve their fulfilment, stand up for themselves and even solve a murder mystery. At the same time, not everyone enjoys these changes to the status quo as dark secrets within the community are threatening to come out.</p>
        
            <p>I did enjoy this novel. Many parts of it were funny and even inspiring, and I learned a lot about a culture so far removed from my own. Author Jaswal is very good at showing the conflict between generations of immigration and also how different and difficult sexuality is when imagined through a different cultural background. The empowerment of women in a culture that we (Westerners) understand as seeing women as inferior shows that there is not just one way of feminism and that progress is progress.</p>
        
            <p>However, the novel was not what I had expected from its title and description, and I was disappointed at the general lack of focus on the development of the characters and the main plot. Jaswal makes sure every single character – no matter how small – has a backstory, which seems like a great idea initially but causes two problems: 1. The novel constantly switches between characters, their backstories, their side stories, and their main (erotic) stories, which makes the overall plot feel rushed. 2. There are way too many plot points, which makes it almost impossible to properly develop all of them and again makes the story fell rushed. I read the novel months ago, and just at the top of my head I can think of all of these plot points (spoilers!):</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Nikki’s struggle with her future and fulfilling her parents’ expectations as a second-generation immigrant</li>
                <li>Nikki and her family dealing with her father’s death</li>
                <li>Nikki’s sister Mindi wanting an arranged marriage and meeting potential husbands</li>
                <li>Nikki starting a relationship with another Punjabi man</li>
                <li>Nikki’s boyfriend actually being already married, Nikki dealing with that revelation and them reuniting</li>
                <li>Nikki trying to find a specific book she once saw in India but cannot find anywhere else</li>
                <li>Nikki having trouble with colleagues at the pub she works</li>
                <li>Nikki signing up to teach the writing class</li>
                <li>The widows not being able to write</li>
                <li>The widows’ interest in erotic stories and ultimately writing/telling erotic stories</li>
                <li>The actual erotic stories</li>
                <li>Kulwinder (who works for the Community Center) struggling to keep the class open and disagreeing with Nikki</li>
                <li>Kulwinder being blackmailed</li>
                <li>The death of Kulwinder’s daughter as the murder mystery that needs to be solved</li>
                <li>The Brotherhood, a group of young men within the community who are against the widows learning how to write and threaten Nikki</li>
                <li>The widows finding empowerment (some more than others), saving Nikki’s life and solving who murdered Kulwinder’s daughter</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Being read through the eyes of a white Western woman, there is a good chance that my understanding of which plot points were important and which were not is jaded. I simply do not know what it is like in the communities of a different culture. In fact, many of the plot points that I thought were absolutely unnecessary actually started to make a lot of sense once I started to think about them in the right cultural context.</p>
        
            <p>For example, I initially was naïve enough to think the book should have just been about Punjabi widows <em>writing</em> erotic stories and finding empowerment through these actions. I was very surprised when those widows turned out to be illiterate because it had never even crossed my privileged mind that that was a very real possibility. A novel about Punjabi widows learning how to write (either because they want to write down their erotic stories or they then accidentally stumble into writing erotic stories) could have been immensely powerful. However, in the actual plot, most of the widows quickly lose interest in learning how to write and just want to focus on talking about sex. This gives comic relief in a story that could have tackled a serious topic in a heartwarming way, yet it also seemingly blocks any character development. Rather than the book stretching over a longer period and focusing on these widows learning how to write, finding empowerment and even writing erotica, the story actually uses shortcuts that to me completely undermined what the novel was supposed to be about. The widows simply ask a younger widow who is already literate (I still do not understand why she is in the group to start with) to write down their stories, and after that, the main story no longer focuses on teaching them how to write.</p>
        
            <p>Similarly, I initially thought the character of Nikki was unnecessary, despite her being the main character. I had very little interest in Nikki whatsoever and again would have rather focused on the widows, their experiences and their developments. It does, however, make sense to have a younger character in this story. Jaswal wanted to show the cultural difference between traditional and modern, British-born Sikh women, and it was important to see that young women very much struggle to fulfil the expectations of both their parents’ culture as well as the culture of the country they grew up in. Jaswal also wanted to show that not only the widows learned from Nikki, but Nikki also learned from the widows and every character ends up in a more empowered situation at the end of the book. I found, however, many of Nikki’s storylines boring and unnecessary. It seems as if Jaswal desperately wanted to make her main character as rounded as possible – which should have been a good thing – but therefore added many side stories which, as mentioned before, only made the main story seem more rushed. There was no need for a love interest, and especially for a love interest that then also gets another side story. There was no need for Nikki’s quest for this one book that she once saw in India and still regrets not buying. There is no need for Nikki’s father being dead and her and her family having to deal with this. Even the story of Nikki's sister Mindi looking for an arranged marriage makes sense in the overall plot but still stole valuable time from showing the widows’ development.</p>
        
            <p>The Brotherhood is another storyline that, as a white woman, I do not seem to fully understand. I assume it makes sense that these men find insult in these women wanting to learn how to write, and I assume it is possible this would create a danger to the widows and also Nikki. However, there are two dangers within the story: one comes from the Brotherhood, the other comes from the murderer of Kulwinder’s daughter. I think it was overly dramatic to have two dangers in a relatively short book, especially because the Brotherhood’s storyline never is actually resolved. At the end of the book, they are still there and had little to do in the overall plot except disguise that Kulwinder is actually stalked by her daughter’s murderer rather than a member of the Brotherhood.</p>
        
            <p>I was not a big fan of the murder mystery storyline and no matter how I turn it, I think it could have easily been dropped. This was not a crime book and there is little focus on it except to show how miserable Kulwinder is. There was no need for Nikki to solve this murder and to then add an extra layer of danger when she confronts the murderer and eventually is saved by the widows. Yes, it shows that the widows have gained confidence, but this should have been shown in their daily life rather than in a forced high-pressure situation they will never have to face again. I assume Jaswal wanted to include this storyline to show that honour kills are still a reality, but it did not need to be such a massive part of the plot. Rather, it should have been simply part of Kulwinder’s backstory, or it should have been part of the Brotherhood’s storyline.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, I think <i>Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows</i> had a very good premise but in my eyes was badly executed because it focused too much on drama rather than on what could have been an inspiring and empowering story about these widows. I am sure many people enjoy the novel because of its many plot points, but I personally wanted to read a book about Punjabi women challenging their culture and writing erotic stories, and the to me excessively dramatic plot points distracted from this story. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed reading the book as it not only taught me more about a culture I am very disconnected from, but also forced me to challenge my own cultural naivety. I would probably still tell people about this book, but simply warn them that it is not exactly what the title suggests.</p>
